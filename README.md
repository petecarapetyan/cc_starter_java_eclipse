# Starter Project for Java and the Eclipse IDE

A template starter for instantiating a plain java project, with Eclipse metadata

## Advantages to using this project

- You won't be confused by, and forced to use static methods and class variables that you don't yet understand.
- Easy to set up and get started
- Sets up some defaults to use as examples for getting started coding
- Perhaps more like the projects you will be using on the job

## Disadvantages to using this project

- Slightly different project than what the video lessons show
- More material here than you will initially need
- Shows unit test that you won't do until Assignment 7

## How to

- Create your project on github, not your local drive, by clicking the green template button
- Clone this down to your local drive in the appropriate workspace directory
- Import this project as an existing Eclipse project
- Start your coding in App.java's execute() method

## To remove unwanted boilerplate

Some example code is included in this project. Depending on your skill level, 

- You may wish to delete it immediately if it is not helpful
- You may wish to leave it around for a while if it might be helpful

But if you hand this project in as an assignment, you probably want to delete anything that is not a part of the assignment.

## Other notes:

- This project attempts to enforce a Java 11 version on the user. This is intentional, as this is a standard in the bootcamp.
- This project is like it's sibling project, which is virtually identical except for being a maven project import.
